This project was created during my graduation internship at ING Bank, together with another graduate student. The game is intended to be played at events/conferences for just a couple of minutes. Gameplay can't be too complicated and has to be quickly engaging.
My contributions are the gameplay, minigame, track gen and SteamVR optimizations, as well as visuals such as the timers in the capsules and particle systems.
The minigame was part of my research and makes use of Dynamic Difficulty Scaling, making the minigame easier or harder during gameplay depending on how well the user does, as well as simply being a fun personal challenge to see how well you do.

You move from capsule to capsule and try to obtain as many points as you can by shooting the gifts.
The interior of the capsule is done by procedural content generation and changes each time. This was the research of my partner.

New pathways are created during runtime so you can easily adjust the scene without breaking anything.
